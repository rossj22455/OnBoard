# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a a replica of the Driod Personatly Chips from Walt Disney World Star Wars Galaxys Edge. This chips allow for Custom Built driods from the park to give custom sounds and effects I choose. 
I am planning to use this board as a start to make sounds disney wont sell like C3PO or A Battle Droid.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The boards are pretty tiny and are fairly cheap. To produce 5 boards bare it cost around 2 dollars.To fully build the boards in house it will cost 15 dollars.
I would prefer if they could be built in house, as it is a very small board.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
